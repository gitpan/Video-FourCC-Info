	Updated test messages

2009-07-24  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Silence Module::CPANTS::Kwalitee notes about what we're using (Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage)

2009-07-24  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	The last variables using TEST_AUTHOR now use RELEASE_TESTING|AUTOMATED_TESTING

2009-07-24  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	More cleanup of author tests

2009-07-24  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Overhaul test scripts, remove them from Recommends (Alias' journal #5375)

2009-07-24  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Changed license field back to LICENSE

2009-07-23  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Update LICENSE and README to a smaller format. Clarify POD. No longer generates a readme using pod2text

2009-07-22  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Require Internet (TEST_INTERNET) to do the signature test, since it tries to download the key from a keyserver

2009-06-14  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	No longer enforce "one dot only" in filenames. This breaks compatibility with OpenVMS.

2009-06-14  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Updated perlcriticrc

2009-05-13  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Updated LICENSE (removed some old text)

2009-05-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Used clearer license - PD (fallback on MIT, Artistic-2+, GPL-2+)

2009-05-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added the databases' SQL source as source-data.sql

2009-05-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Bumped version to 1.1.5
	- Moved bin/peekvideo to an example file because it depends on Video::Info which is non-free
	- Removed t/03scripts.t and related requirements (Test::Script etc) because peekvideo is no longer in bin/

2009-04-30  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Dropped TEST_DATA from t/99data.t
	- Made t/03scripts.t still work in case the tests are skipped
	- Bumped version to 1.1.4

2009-04-29  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Changed t/03scripts.t to only run if Video::Info is installed (otherwise compile fails since it's required for the peekvideo script)
	- Updated to version 1.20 for DBD::SQLite, since the multiple defines error is fixed in that version
	-> the hack code was removed
	-> This should also improve code coverage
	- Bumped version to 1.1.3 to prepare for release (again)

2009-04-29  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Updated license & copyright information

2009-04-29  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added t/99data.t to MANIFEST
	- Fixed bin/peekvideo (using {*FH} calls to print)

2009-04-29  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Removed prereq test
	- Removed CHANGES file (which is automatically generated now)
	- Changed license to Public Domain
	- Minor doc changes in Video/FourCC/Info.pm
	- Makefile.PL changed to passthrough from traditional
	- Added ignore for debian/ control files and .tmp files
	- Removed interface description from README; you can get that from the POD
	- Bumped version up to 1.1.2 to prepare for release

2009-04-24  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added Build.bat to MANIFEST.SKIP for Win32 builds...

2009-03-16  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Removed version-specific stuff from the README so I can be lazy (it was out-of-date anyway)
	- Corrected svn:keywords property

2009-03-16  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Upgraded version to 1.1.2
	- Removed use of Test::Prereq due to requiring a live connection
	- Fixed MANIFEST; using a Changes file now

2009-02-27  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added tests (99data.t) to ensure data integrity
	- Forced PerlCritic to ignore that hackish thing I did with DBD::SQLite::sqlite_version
	- Removed the check for defined $description; it must always be defined per the data constraint check
	- Updated the codecs.dat - fixed typos and stuff.

2009-02-27  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Put braces around {STDERR} filehandle for peekvideo
	- Silenced the complaint about package variables, since we are using that hack to prevent a bug from DBD::SQLite from causing warnings

2009-02-27  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Fixed version requirements

2009-02-26  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Removed taint mode from 01prereq.t - File::Find chdir's

2009-02-20  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Updated Build.PL prerequisites and added a hack to 01prereq.t to fix a bug - Test::Prereq::Build does not provide a "add_build_element" method

2009-02-20  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added svn:keywords. I wonder if I can set a default somehow :-)

2009-02-20  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added some more tests :-)

2009-02-08  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Moved the hack code to prevent DBD::SQLite related warnings to the actual Info.pm module file (and thus shrank some of the tests back to the normal size)

2009-02-07  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Changed version to 1.1.1 instead (since there has not been an API change since 1.1)

2009-02-07  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Update to version 1.2

2009-02-07  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added Test::NoWarnings to 01compile.t
	- Added check code to prevent warnings like: Name "DBD::SQLite::sqlite_version" used only once: possible typo (this is the reason for 90% of failing CPAN Testers reports, and is outside of my direct control)
	- Delayed import of Test::NoWarnings (delays loading of test hooks until tests are planned)

2009-01-19  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Don't uppercase the fourcc until we know it is defined

2009-01-19  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Update change history to prepare for release

2009-01-19  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Updated the POD and README

2009-01-19  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Updated database so that all FourCC codes are uppercase
	- Gave codecs.dat a mime-type of application/x-sqlite3
	- Added arbitrary case FourCC lookups (treat them as case-insensitive. I'm not sure if this is the right thing to do, but this is what the GSpot codec appliance does)
	- Updated tests to ensure that case insensitivity is working

2009-01-19  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Tagged version 1.1
	-> Updated META.yml and Info.pm to match
	- Updated change history

2009-01-19  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Updated svn:keyword property

2009-01-17  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added a reference to the main Video::FourCC::Info's SUPPORT heading in peekvideo

2009-01-17  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- SIGNATUREs are distribution only and don't need to be versioned
	- Added requirement to have a SUPPORT section in POD

2009-01-17  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Initial commit of Video::FourCC::Info

2009-01-17  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added directories for Test::DistManifest and Video::FourCC::Info
